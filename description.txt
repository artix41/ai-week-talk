Deep learning Methods for Domain Adaptation

Domain adaptation is the art of generalizing a task you learned on one dataset to a similar but somewhat different dataset. 
Imagine you managed to build a very good dataset of daylight photos for your automatic driving company, but your cars keep having accident at night. 
Don't worry, you can use domain adaptation to transfer your knowledge of day images to the night ones without any label in the later dataset!

Are you trying to analyse user feedbacks on your product but have found a huge dataset only for a different product? Once again, domain adaptation allows you to adapt the distributions 
and make useful predictions on your own data!

Situations where the training set and the test set don't come from the exact same distribution are very common, and the recent methods in deep generative models have lead to new incredible results.

Excited about this recent field which gonna revolutionize machine learning and curious to learn the state-of-the-art methods in this area?
Come Tuesday in the Castle for an amazing night!
